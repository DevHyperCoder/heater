Heat up a Discord bot in a blink

## What is Heater?

Heater is a Command Line Interface tool which allows you to generate a barebones Python Discord bot project, just in a matter of seconds.

## Getting Started

Install Heater by running `pip install discord-heater` on your Terminal or Command Prompt.

To generate a project, just type `discord-heater` or `python -m discord-heater`. Then it will ask you a few questions (name of the project,
dependencies, prefix, etc).

Once you are done:

-   Run `cd` to go into the folder that Heater generates for you.
-   Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies
-   Lastly, run `python bot.py` to run the bot.
